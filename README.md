- **Real Weather**: Uses WeatherAPI for up-to-date forecasts
- **Beginner Friendly**: Step-by-step setup, no prior Python or AI experience needed

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (for local LLM)
- A free [WeatherAPI key](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

### 2. **Clone the Repo**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/the5thwright/LocalWeatherGenie.git
cd LocalWeatherGenie
```

### 3. **Set Up Python Environment**
```sh
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. **Install Ollama and the Mistral Model**
- Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)
- Open a terminal and run:
  ```sh
  ollama pull mistral
  ollama run mistral
  ```
  This will download and start the Mistral model locally.
- **Alternative (Hugging Face):** If you want to use a different model, see [Ollama's docs](https://ollama.com/library) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) for compatible models.

### 6. **Get a WeatherAPI Key**
- Sign up at [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- Copy your API key
- Open `weather_bot.py` and replace `YOUR_WEATHERAPI_KEY_HERE` with your key

### 7. **Run the Bot!**
```sh
python weather_bot.py
```
- Enter a location (e.g., `Marion, IN` or `London`) when prompted
- Get a friendly, AI-generated weather report

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Ollama not running/model not found:**
  - Make sure you ran `ollama run mistral` in a separate terminal
  - The script will check and tell you if Ollama or the model is missing
- **WeatherAPI 502 or quota errors:**
  - Wait and try again (API outages are common on free plans)
  - Check your API key and quota at [WeatherAPI dashboard](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/)
- **Python errors:**
  - Make sure you activated your virtual environment and installed dependencies
- **See `changelog.txt`** for detailed logs of all actions and errors

---

## üß© Extending LocalWeatherGenie
- **Change the prompt**: Edit the `prompt` in `generate_report()` for different report styles
- **Add chat mode**: Use the same Ollama API to build a chat tool (see [Ollama API docs](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md))
- **Schedule reports**: Use Windows Task Scheduler or `cron` to run the script automatically
- **Send reports by email/SMS**: Integrate with `smtplib` or Twilio
- **Add a GUI**: Use `tkinter` or another Python GUI library

## üìù Example Output
```
Enter a location (e.g., 'Marion, IN' or 'London'): Marion, IN
Good morning Marion! It's going to be a lovely day today with clear skies and high temperatures reaching 76 degrees. Sunrise is at 6:28 AM and sunset will be around 8:47 PM. The average humidity will be about 71%, so it should feel comfortable outside. And great news, there's no chance of rain today! Enjoy your day!
